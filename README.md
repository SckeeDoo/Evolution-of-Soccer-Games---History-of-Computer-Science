"Intellivision's NASL Soccer featured stick figures as players," says O' Shea. "Yet, at the time, this was 'the closest thing to the real thing' – which was their marketing slogan."
"Pelé's Soccer on the Atari 2600 followed shortly after. Even at this early stage, having the endorsement of a big name player was a major factor in the success of the game – despite the graphics being very basic. And then this was followed by a flood of games in the 1980s that were all looking to get the formula right for the new home computer market. This period saw the release of the highly popular Emlyn Hughes International Soccer for the ZX Spectrum."
However, it wasn't until 1992 and the release of Sensible Soccer that the footballing game industry really took off. Generally recognised as the first truly great football computer game, Soccer had it all. Thanks to highly addictive, fun gameplay and iconic and stylised graphics which remain striking to this day, Sensible Soccer was an immediate hit.
