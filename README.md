#Evolution of Soccer Video Games

The first Soccer Video game was released in 1979 called NASL Soccer. Also in 1979 Video magazine puclished a reviw stating thet NASL Soccer was "Even for those who a not really into soccer or sports in general". Almost after 40 years soccer video games still hold a very important appeal seen nowhere else in gaming industry. This games has no age, played by bouth young and adult gamers, the genre has seen franchises come and go, not to mention numerous innovations in the way the beautiful game is depicted into a digital form.

NASL Soccer featured stick figures as players, yet, at the time this was the closest thing to the real thing. After that apears Pele's Soccer on the Atari 2600. Even at this early stage, having this big name player was a major factor in the succes of the game - despite the graphics were very basic and not so good.

After that was followed a lot of games in the 1980s that were all looking to get  the right formula for the new home computer market. Also in this perioud was the release of highly popular Emly Hughes International Soccer for the ZX Spectrum. However, it wasn't until 1992 and the release of Sensible Soccer that the footballing game industry really took off. this was the first really football computer game. This game had it all, it was highly addictive, fun gameplay and there good graphics for that time. So Sensible Soccer was the hit of that time.

The next generation game came with FIFA and PES series. they had astonished graphics compared to its previous brothers. the game also came with Fotball MAnager games by including a feature allowing gamers to transfer players and administratate their own clubs. This was a new way of playing soccer games. the most succesful manager game of the nineties began as Championship Manager - a game developed by to american brothers Paul and Oliver Collyer. they created this game in their bedroom in 1992.
Live action footbal gaming as fotball manager seemed to EA SPORTS a very good ideea to impliment and to take to a hole new level. So they began to made FIFA series every year since 1991, until in 2001 KONAM lunched their Pro Evolution Soccer (picture bellow). Since then, both series vied for supremacy of the market, with FIFA largely having won out.

Of course in nowdays things changed a lot. In the pursuit on realism in computer gaming, EA SPORTS have gone to the extremes and emplyed Hollywood-style motion capture tehnology, so the motion to be super realistic. They even invited soccer player like Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero to capture their gesture, mannerisms and movement feature prominebtly in our enviroment and show just how far these can go and how deep they are into this business. Also they invited all players from AFC Bournemouth to for a complex "head-scaning" for the new FIFA game - a proces which capture the facial expressions of every single player.

Wth virtual reality gaming on the rise it is only a matter of time before footballing computer games upgrade once more to a whole new level. Because the requirement of gamers a bigger and bigger, as they wanna be surrounded by the sounds of the game and feel as if they are on the field and to feel like Messi or Ronaldo. this is already startind to become a part of how sports are presented to television nowdays football are filmed very professional with a lot of cameras and microphones on the referees'and playes' bodies and thats why I think pumping the evolution of football gaming is such an amazing story to tell.
